# Warehouse-Wreckage-Project-Files
 WarehouseWreckage is an exciting physics-based game set in a massive warehouse environment. Players can freely navigate the space using the WASDEQ keys, allowing for full 3D movement. Armed with a powerful metal cannon, players can shoot cannonballs at various physics-simulated construction barrels and other objects by pressing the spacebar. With a limited ammo of 20 cannonballs, strategic aiming and shooting are key. Once all ammo is depleted, a "Out of Stock" message appears, and the game restarts after a 5-second countdown, offering endless fun and replayability.
